            <p>The idea is use the same model as fivver does. They show the user's selected Gig/Service as a separate page.</p>
            <p>This allow: - use the history on browser, maybe intended for after login events, so we redirect the user to the initial Gig/service.</p>
            <p>But as you can see right now I am showing the selected Gig/Job as a window on top.</p>
